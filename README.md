# SpacemanDMM

**SpacemanDMM** is a suite of tools for working with [DreamMaker] codebases
and map files. It features a full-size fancy map renderer, a [language server],
and a documentation generator for DM codebases.

Binary releases are posted to the [releases] page.

Support is currently provided in /tg/station13's coderbus (ping `SpaceManiac`)
and on GitHub's issue tracker. Pull requests are welcome.

## [Language Server](src/langserver/)

SpacemanDMM includes a [language server] providing autocomplete,
go-to-definition, and more for the DreamMaker language. The preferred
installation method is the [Visual Studio Code plugin][vsc], which will update
with newly-released language server binaries automatically. Details on
available features are listed in the language server's
[package readme][ls-readme].

The VS Code plugin is currently hosted in a [separate repository][vsc-src].

Use `cargo build -p dm-langserver` to build a local copy of the language server
for debugging or development purposes. The plugin can be configured to run a
locally built language server rather than the binary releases.

## [Map Renderer](src/cli/)

`dmm-tools` is SpacemanDMM's map renderer. It generates full-sized map images
and emulates many in-game graphical enhancements not usually visible in the map
editor, including overlays and smoothing. These features currently assume
[/tg/station13], but are highly likely to work on downstreams or closely
related codebases.

Basic usage: `dmm-tools minimap _maps/map_files/BoxStation/BoxStation.dmm`.
For best results, run from the directory containing your `.dme` file.

By default, output is saved to `data/minimaps`, which can be changed with the
`-o` flag. The `-e` flag, specified before the subcommand, can be used to load
a different `.dme` file. More detailed usage information is available in the
`--help` output.

The minimap output is a very large PNG (e.g. 9.3 MB for Box). You are strongly
advised to run the resulting file through image optimization software such as
`pngcrush`. The `--pngcrush` option to the `minimap` subcommand can do this
automatically in many cases, but is off by default for speed reasons.

## [Documentation Generator](src/dmdoc/)

`dmdoc` is a simple Doxygen-esque documentation generator for DreamMaker code.
Files, macros, types, vars, and procs can be documented. Documentation comments
start with `/**` or `///` when preceding the documented item, or `/*!` or `//!`
when contained within it.

By default, only documented types are included in the output, and types with
only a one-line note do not get their own `.html` page. The index shows the
contents of `code/README.md`, and other Markdown files within the `code`
directory are shown alongside documented DM files.

If run in a Git repository, web links to source code are placed next to item
headings in the generated output; otherwise, file and line numbers are shown
but are not linked.

## Building

To build locally, begin by [installing Rust][rust] or updating your existing
installation. SpacemanDMM is tested against stable Rust.

For one-time installation, run
`cargo install --git https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM cli`
to install the `dmm-tools` binary to `~/.cargo/bin`.

For development or easy installation of updates, clone this repository and run
`cargo build -p cli --release` to create `target/release/dmm-tools`. See the
[source readme] for a list of the available packages, or omit `--release` for
a debug build.

Executables are placed in `target/release` or `target/debug` depending on build
type. The CLI binary is known as `dmm-tools`.

## Docker

For convenience, a `dockerfile` is included.

To build the docker image, switch to the directory where you cloned spacemandmm and run:  
```shell
docker build -t spacemandmm .
```

This will locally build an image for spacemandmm. To use the image, switch to the codebase you want to generate maps for (tg is used in the example here, you will need to update this command to fit your codebase):  
```shell
docker run -v "$PWD":/usr/src/codebase --rm -it spacemandmm -e /usr/src/codebase/tgstation.dme minimap /usr/src/codebase/_maps/map_files/BoxStation/BoxStation.dmm
```
