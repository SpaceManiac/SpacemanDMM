# DreamChecker

**DreamChecker** is a robust whole-program static analysis and type checking
engine for DreamMaker, the scripting language of the [BYOND] game engine.

## Running DreamChecker

DreamChecker can be obtained with `cargo build -p dreamchecker` or from the
[releases] page.

DreamChecker should be run from within the DM project directory. It will
automatically detect the `.dme` file, parse it, and issue diagnostics.
DreamChecker will exit with a non-zero status code if it discovers any
diagnostics, making it suitable for use in continuous integration environments.

## Diagnostics

In addition to the simple inline diagnostics discovered by the [parsing suite],
DreamCheckers's whole-program analysis can find problems such as:

[parsing suite]: ../dreammaker/#diagnostics

* Unknown `set` setting names.
* Undefined types on unused variables.
* Keyword arguments being passed to procs which do not accept them.
* Calling procs with non-keyword arguments following keyword arguments.
* Proc overrides which are missing keyword arguments that their parents are
  called with.
* Declaring vars with `/list` in unusual positions, e.g.
  `var/atom/list/movable/L`.
* Use of `src` in global `/proc`s where it is guaranteed to be `null`.
* Calling the parent proc `..()` when no such parent exists.
* Accesses like `L[1].foo` and `foo().bar` wherein `.` acts like `:` instead.
  * List accesses perform lookups according to the type appended to `/list`,
    e.g. with `var/list/obj/L`, the type of `L[1]` will be `/obj` and a lookup
    of `L[1].name` will not generate a warning.
  * Proc calls will obey the [return type](#return-type) annotation if present.

## Configuration

DreamChecker can be run with the `-c` switch to specify a TOML configuration
file. For the full list of options see the [configuration docs].

## Extensions

DreamChecker also adds additional typing features to the language through a
series of extensions, described below.
Because DreamMaker does not recognize these extensions, it is recommended that
you use the preprocessor flag `SPACEMAN_DMM` to determine whether they should
be enabled:

```dm
#ifdef SPACEMAN_DMM
	#define RETURN_TYPE(X) set SpacemanDMM_return_type = X
	#define SHOULD_CALL_PARENT(X) set SpacemanDMM_should_call_parent = X
	#define UNLINT(X) SpacemanDMM_unlint(X)
	#define SHOULD_NOT_OVERRIDE(X) set SpacemanDMM_should_not_override = X
	#define SHOULD_NOT_SLEEP(X) set SpacemanDMM_should_not_sleep = X
	#define SHOULD_BE_PURE(X) set SpacemanDMM_should_be_pure = X
	#define PRIVATE_PROC(X) set SpacemanDMM_private_proc = X
	#define PROTECTED_PROC(X) set SpacemanDMM_protected_proc = X
	#define CAN_BE_REDEFINED(X) set SpacemanDMM_can_be_redefined = X
	#define VAR_FINAL var/SpacemanDMM_final
	#define VAR_PRIVATE var/SpacemanDMM_private
	#define VAR_PROTECTED var/SpacemanDMM_protected
#else
	#define RETURN_TYPE(X)
	#define SHOULD_CALL_PARENT(X)
	#define UNLINT(X) X
	#define SHOULD_NOT_OVERRIDE(X)
	#define SHOULD_NOT_SLEEP(X)
	#define SHOULD_BE_PURE(X)
	#define PRIVATE_PROC(X)
	#define PROTECTED_PROC(X)
	#define CAN_BE_REDEFINED(X)
	#define VAR_FINAL var
	#define VAR_PRIVATE var
	#define VAR_PROTECTED var
#endif
```

### Return type

Use `set SpacemanDMM_return_type = expression` to set a return type expression
for a proc. The return type can take the forms:

* `/typepath` - a raw typepath. The return type of the proc is the type named.
* `param` - a typepath given as a parameter, for procs which return an instance
  of the passed-in type.
* `param.type` - the static type of a passed-in parameter, for procs which
  return their input or otherwise another value of the same type.
* `param[_].type` - the static type of a passed-in parameter, with one level
  of `/list` stripped, for procs which select one item from a list. The `[_]`
  may be repeated to strip more levels of `/list`.

### Should call parent

Use `set SpacemanDMM_should_call_parent = 1` to enable a diagnostic on children
of the proc it is set on which do not contain any `..()` parent calls. This can
help with finding situations where a signal or other important handling in the
parent proc is being skipped. Child procs may set this setting to `0` instead
to override the check.

### Should not override

Use `set SpacemanDMM_should_not_override = 1` to raise a warning for any child
procs that override this one, regardless of if it calls parent or not.
This functions in a similar way to the `final` keyword in some languages.

This cannot be disabled by child overrides.

### Final variables

Use the above definition of VAR_FINAL to declare vars as `SpacemanDMM_final`,
`var/SpacemanDMM_final/foo` such that overriding their value isn't permitted by
types that inherit it.
```
/a/type
	VAR_FINAL/foo = somevalue
```

### Private / Protected procs

Use `set SpacemanDMM_private_proc = 1` and `set SpacemanDMM_protected_proc = 1` to set procs as private and protected respectively.

* Private procs can only be called by things of exactly the same type
* Protected procs can only be call by things of the same type or subtypes

Additionally, Private procs cannot be overridden.

### Private / Protected vars

Use the above definitions of VAR_PRIVATE and VAR_PROTECTED to declare vars as `SpacemanDMM_private`/`SpacemanDMM_protected`.
These function the same way as the proc versions.

### Should not sleep

Use `set SpacemanDMM_should_not_sleep = 1` to raise a warning if the proc or one
of the sub-procs it calls uses a blocking call, such as `sleep()` or `input()`
without using `set waitfor = 0`

This cannot be disabled by child overrides.

### Should be pure

Use `set SpacemanDMM_should_be_pure = 1` to ensure a proc is 'pure', such that
it does not make any changes outside itself or output.
This also checks to make sure anything using this proc doesn't invoke it without
making use of the return value.

This cannot be disabled by child overrides.

## Proc redefinitions

Multiple definitions of a proc in the same type-path will raise a warning.
Use `set SpacemanDMM_can_be_redefined = 1` to allow a proc to be redefined.
