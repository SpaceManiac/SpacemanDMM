# SpacemanDMM suite configuration

All 'opinionated' errors in the suite have an associated configuration option to redefine their Severity or to disable them completely.

Errors that would fail to compile in the DM compiler or will always cause a runtime cannot be disabled (eg: bad keyword arguments).

As of writing, only DreamChecker has the functionality to accept a configuration file.

## Configuration Options

All of these options can be set to the following:

* `error`, `errors` - Severity::Error
* `warning`, `warnings` - Severity::Warning
* `info`, `infos` - Severity::Info
* `hint`, `hints` - Severity::Hint
* `disabled`, `false`, `off` - Disables it completely
* `unset`, not present in the config file - Uses the default

### Warnings

The `[warnings]` section has the following options:

Raised by DreamChecker:

* `disabled_directive` - Raised when attempting to disable a `set SpacemanDMM_*` directive that cannot be disabled
* `sets_directive_twice` - Raised when a directive is set twice in the same proc
* `invalid_lint_directive_value` - Raised when attempting to set a directive value to something other than `1`, `0`, `TRUE`, `FALSE`
* `unknown_linter_setting` - Raised when setting a `SpacemanDMM_*` directive that DreamChecker doesn't implement
* `override_missing_keyword_arg` - Raised when proc overrides are missing keyword arguments
* `must_not_override` - `SpacemanDMM_should_not_override` directive
* `must_call_parent` - `SpacemanDMM_should_call_parent` directive
* `ambiguous_in_lhs` - Raised on ambiguous operations on the left hand side of an `in` operation
* `no_typehint_implicit_new` - Raised on the use of `new` where no typehint is avaliable
* `field_access_static_type` - Raised on using `.field_name` on a variable with no typehint
* `proc_call_static_type` - Raised on using `.proc_name()` on a variable with no typehint
* `no_operator_overload` - Raised on using a unary operator on a non-primative that doesn't define it's own override, eg `somemob++`

Raised by Lexer:

* `integer_precision_loss` - Raised where an integer is out of integer range and is implicitly formatted as a float

Raised by Parser:

* `var_in_proc_parameter` - Raised where `var/` is used in proc arguments
* `static_in_proc_parameter` - Raised where `static/` is used in proc arguments
* `in_precedes_as` - Raised where `input()` calls are using `as` after `in` which DM silently ignores
* `tmp_no_effect` - Raised where local vars are defined as `tmp` which has no effect
* `final_no_effect` - Raised where local vars are defined as `SpacemanDMM_final` which has no effect
* `as_local_var` - Raised where local vars are defined using the `as Foo` syntax which has no effect

Raised by PreProcessor:

* `duplicate_include` - Raised where the same file is included twice
* `macro_redefined` - Raised where a macro is defined a second time
* `macro_undefined_no_definition` - Raised where a macro is undefined where no such macro is defined

### Display

The `[display]` section has the following options:

* `error_level` - Sets the level at which errors are registered instead of being ignored
* `print_level` - Sets the level at which errors are printed as they are raised.

If `error_level` has a higher threshold than `print_level`, the error will still be printed but it won't be considered for overall success.

## Example

```toml
[warnings]
duplicate_include = "error"

[display]
error_level = "hint"

print_level = "error"
```
